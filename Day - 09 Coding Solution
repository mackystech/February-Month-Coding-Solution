Day - 9. Question: Create a program that takes two numbers as input and performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on them. Display the results.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a = 10;
    int b = 5;
    
    int sum = a+b;
    cout<<"Sum: "<<sum<<endl;
    
    int sub = a-b;
    cout<<"Substraction: "<<sub<<endl;
    
    int mul = a*b;
    cout<<"Multiplication: "<<mul<<endl;
    
    int division= a/b;
    cout<<"Division: "<<division<<endl;
    

    return 0;
}


Output:

Sum: 15
Substraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2
