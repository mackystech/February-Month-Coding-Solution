Day - 10: Question : Write a program that compares two numbers and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    int a = 10;
    int b = 10;
    
    if(a<b){
        cout<<"A is less tha B"<<endl;
    }
    else if(a>b){
        cout<<"A is greater than B"<<endl;
    }
    else{
        cout<<"A & B both are equal"<<endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}

Output:

A & B both are equal
